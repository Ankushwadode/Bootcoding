## How To Run

Clone the Repository on your machine and open it with your favorite IDE, Personally I use Intellij to code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankushwadode/Bootcoding.git
```

## Usage

The Repository contains 6 different code files.
Look for Apartment Info code which implements solid principles
with generics in Java.
